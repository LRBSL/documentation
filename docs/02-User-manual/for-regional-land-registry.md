# Use Cases - 2

## Land Ownership Change & Land Partitioning

- For both use cases, a validated transaction request by three notaries will be sent to the RLR where the land is situated, for committing to the blockchain.

- RLR can view and commit transaction requests that retrieved by the respective section in the application sidebar after checking necessary information.

- The land transaction request will be sent to another two more RLRs that hold copies of the ledger.

- If the transaction request obtains two or more up-votes, the request will be committed to the blockchain. Otherwise, transaction request failure will be reported to RLRs and relevant public notaries.

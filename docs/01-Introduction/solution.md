# Blockchain as a Solution

This software implementation was based on the research of *“Permissioned Distributed Ledgers For Land Transactions” by Ms. D. T. Fernando and Dr. D. N. Ranasinghe*.

By this application, we are only addressed two main use cases of the land registration process in Sri Lanka. which are,

1. Land ownership changing from a person to another
2. Land forking/partitioning to two child lands without ownership change

In the implementation, **Hyperledger-Fabric** open-source permissioned distributed ledger framework is used for the blockchain and **Angular CLI** is used for the web-based frontend application development.
**Convector Suite**, a third party framework is used for configurating the Hyperledger-fabric project.
